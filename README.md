Data Collection Image-based Gender Classification: The dataset consists of images of faces, labeled with the gender (male or female). Popular datasets include: CelebA: A large-scale celebrity face attributes dataset. IMDB-WIKI: Contains images of celebrities along with gender and age labels. Voice-based Gender Classification: The dataset includes audio recordings labeled with gender. Some common datasets are: Common Voice by Mozilla. VoxCeleb dataset.
Preprocessing Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques (rotation, scaling, etc.) to improve the model's generalization ability. Voice Preprocessing: Includes converting audio recordings into spectrograms, extracting features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and normalizing audio signals.
Model Architecture For image-based classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used due to their ability to capture spatial features in images. For voice-based classification, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or even CNNs can be used to model the sequential data present in audio recordings.
Training the Model Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: Since gender classification is usually a binary classification problem (male/female), the binary cross-entropy loss function is used. Optimizer: Typically, Adam or RMSProp are used for optimization. Batch Size & Epochs: These hyperparameters depend on the size of the dataset and computational resources. Batch sizes of 32 or 64 are common, and the model is trained for 10–50 epochs, depending on performance on the validation set.
Evaluation Accuracy: The percentage of correct classifications. Confusion Matrix: Used to visualize the model’s performance and identify where the model is making mistakes (e.g., misclassifying males as females). Precision, Recall, F1-score: These metrics can provide a better understanding of the model’s performance, especially in cases of class imbalance.
Deployment Once the model is trained, it can be deployed for inference in various applications, such as:
Real-time gender prediction from camera images (for targeted advertisements). Voice gender recognition systems for voice-controlled devices.
